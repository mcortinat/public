	abstract = {Increasing the probability of paying child support, in addition to increasing resources available for investment in children, may also alter the incentives faced by men to have children out of wedlock. We find that strengthening child support enforcement leads men to have fewer out-of-wedlock births and among those who do become fathers, to do so with more educated women and those with a higher propensity to invest in children. Thus, policies that compel men to pay child support may affect child outcomes through two pathways: an increase in financial resources and a birth selection process.},

	abstract = {This study examines the total package of child support that mothers receive from the nonresident fathers of their children, by focusing on three components of total support: formal cash, informal cash, and in-kind support. Using the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, this article considers how contributions change over time and the effects of child support enforcement on these contributions. Findings suggest that total cash support received drops precipitously over the first 15 months of living apart (as informal support drops off) and then increases slightly after 45 months (as the increase in formal support overtakes the decrease in informal support). While the study finds no effect of enforcement on total support received in the first 5 years after a nonmarital birth, the substantial differences in total cash support received by the length of time that parents have not been cohabiting suggest that strong enforcement may be efficacious over time.},

	abstract = {The Child Support Recovery Unit (CSRU) within the Iowa Department of Human Services is responsible for establishing and enforcing child support orders across the state. As part of a comprehensive effort to actualize services, CSRU and university partners developed and evaluated a positive family support model to maintain relationships with non-custodial parents. This article describes the evolution of the programming and examines the association between targeted child support enforcement initiative (termed Projecting Positivity Promotes Positivity and Cultural Change or Px4C2) and non-custodial parents’ support payments. We use the difference-in-differences framework to estimate the intervention effects on non-custodial parents’ child support. Results from the program evaluation model and payment data suggest a positive association with increased child support payments by 25 dollars on average and a 6.1 percentage point increase in the ratios of child support payments to child support dues. Results suggest that while this new approach was associated with increases for all non-custodial parents, the association was stronger for those who did not have a formal child support enforcement measure or mechanism in place prior to the intervention.},

	abstract = {Past research suggests that increasing the incomes of single mothers will bring integenerational benefits. However, some sources of income may be more beneficial to children than others. This paper evaluates the effects of child support payments from absent fathers on children's achievement test scores and home environments, using three methods to control for heterogeneity among families. The results provide evidence that increased child support payments may improve the academic achievement of elementary school-age children even more than income from other sources. While overall family income appears to affect levels of cognitive stimulation available in children's homes, child support does not have larger effects than other sources of income. These findings suggest that increasing the financial contributions of absent fathers through improved child support enforcement or other interventions may be a particularly beneficial income support strategy for children in single mother families.},
